    "## Why Feature Extraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder: **Why not just feed the raw audio and IMU signals directly into a machine learning model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why feature extraction is essential:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Size reduction**: A 0.4-second window contains 6,400 audio samples. Instead of processing all 6,400 values, we extract just 65 meaningful features that capture the \"essence\" of the sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Noise reduction**: Raw signals contain a lot of irrelevant information and noise. Features focus on what matters - patterns that distinguish coughs from other sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Better learning**: Machine learning models learn faster and more accurately from compact, meaningful features than from thousands of raw signal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy**: Imagine describing a person. Instead of showing a full high-resolution photo (raw signal), you describe key features: height, eye color, age, build (extracted features). Both convey information, but features are more compact and focused on what matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll extract **105 features** that capture the unique characteristics of cough sounds and motions."

   "source": [
    "## Feature Categories Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Our 105 features are organized into two main groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Category | Count | What It Captures | Example Use Case |\n",
    "|----------|-------|------------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **Audio Features** | **65** | Sound characteristics from microphone | |\n",
    "| → MFCC | 52 | Sound \"texture\" or \"timbre\" | Distinguishing cough from speech |\n",
    "| → Spectral | 10 | Frequency distribution | High-pitched vs low-pitched sounds |\n",
    "| → Time-domain | 3 | Loudness and sharpness | Sudden bursts vs gradual sounds |\n",
    "| **IMU Features** | **40** | Body motion from sensors | |\n",
    "| → Accelerometer | 20 | Linear motion (chest/body movement) | Detecting physical cough motion |\n",
    "| → Gyroscope | 20 | Rotational motion (head/neck) | Detecting head movement during cough |\n",
    "| **Total** | **105** | Complete multimodal signature | Robust cough detection |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Both Audio AND Motion Sensors?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multimodal sensing is more robust than either modality alone:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **When audio struggles**: Noisy environments (music, traffic, other people talking)\n",
    "  - IMU still captures the physical motion of coughing\n",

    "## Understanding Sampling and Sample Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can extract features from audio and IMU signals, we need to understand how these **continuous real-world signals** become **discrete digital data** that computers can process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Sampling?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sampling** is the process of converting a continuous analog signal (like sound waves or motion) into a discrete digital signal by taking measurements at regular intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy**: Imagine you're watching a car drive by:\n",
    "- **Continuous (analog)**: The car moves smoothly through space\n",
    "- **Discrete (digital)**: You take snapshots every 0.1 seconds to track its position\n",
    "\n",
    "The snapshots are your **samples**, and how often you take them is your **sampling rate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Sample Rate (Sampling Frequency)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample rate** (also called **sampling frequency**) is the number of samples taken per second, measured in **Hertz (Hz)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- **16,000 Hz** means 16,000 samples per second\n",
    "- **100 Hz** means 100 samples per second\n",
    "\n",
    "**Higher sample rate** = more snapshots per second = more detailed representation of the signal\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Sensors and Their Sample Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cough detection project, we use two types of sensors with different sample rates:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Sensor | Sample Rate | Samples per Second | What It Captures |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **Microphone** | 16,000 Hz | 16,000 | Sound waves (cough, speech, ambient noise) |\n",
    "| **IMU (Accelerometer + Gyroscope)** | 100 Hz | 100 | Body motion (chest movement, head rotation) |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why different rates?**\n",
    "- **Audio** changes very rapidly (sound frequencies range from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz), so we need a high sample rate to capture it accurately\n",
    "- **Body motion** changes much more slowly than sound waves, so 100 samples/second is sufficient\n",
    "\n",
    "### From Real World to Digital Samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what happens in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "**When you cough:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Microphone** measures air pressure 16,000 times per second → Creates an array of 16,000 numbers per second\n",
    "2. **Accelerometer** measures chest acceleration 100 times per second → Creates an array of 100 numbers per second\n",
    "3. **Gyroscope** measures body rotation 100 times per second → Creates an array of 100 numbers per second\n",
    "\n",
    "**A 1-second recording produces:**\n",
    "- Audio: 16,000 values (numbers representing sound amplitude)\n",
    "- IMU: 100 values for each of the 6 channels (3 accelerometer axes + 3 gyroscope axes) = 600 values total\n",
    "\n",
    "These arrays of numbers are what we'll work with for feature extraction!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Does This Matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding sample rate is crucial because:\n",
    "1. It tells us **how much data** we're working with\n",
    "2. It determines **time-to-sample conversion** (e.g., \"0.5 seconds = 8,000 audio samples\")\n",
    "3. It affects **window sizes** for machine learning (explained in the next section)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Window Length ↔ Sample Count Relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of samples in a window depends on the **sampling frequency**:\n",

    "#### 🎯 CRITICAL INSIGHTS FROM THIS EXAMPLE\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Audio features dominate discrimination** - all top 15 are audio, NO IMU in top 15!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Spectral features >> MFCC features**:\n",
    " - Spectral Kurtosis (rank 1): Measures frequency distribution 'peakiness'\n",
    " - Spectral Skewness (rank 2): Measures frequency distribution asymmetry\n",
    " - Spectral Rolloff (rank 3): 6x higher for cough (2547 vs 414 Hz)\n",
    " - Spectral Centroid (rank 4): 3x higher for cough (988 vs 312 Hz)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Why spectral features win in THIS example**:\n",
    " - This is a quiet environment (sitting, no background noise)\n",
    " - Coughs have sharp, broadband spectral bursts (high kurtosis/skewness)\n",
    " - Throat-clearing has concentrated low-frequency energy\n",
    " - The spectral difference is dramatic and easily separable\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Context matters - this is ONE example**:\n",
    " - In noisy environments (music, traffic), IMU features become MORE critical\n",
    " - Multimodal (audio + IMU) provides robustness across ALL conditions\n",
    " - This notebook shows feature extraction; actual model uses ALL 105 features\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Next step**: Train XGBoost on the full dataset → Model_Training_XGBoost.ipynb\n",
    " - You'll see how feature importance changes across 15 subjects and all conditions\n",
    " - The model learns when to rely on audio vs IMU vs both"

    "### What We Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we transformed raw biosignal data into machine learning-ready features:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Raw Data → Features:**\n",
    "- **Input**: 0.4-second windows (6,400 audio samples + 40 IMU samples per window)\n",
    "- **Output**: 105 compact features per window\n",
    "- **Compression**: From ~6,440 values → 105 values (61× reduction!)\n",

    "| **MFCC** | 52 | Capture sound texture/timbre |\n",
    "| **Spectral** | 10 | Describe frequency distribution |\n",
    "| **Time-domain** | 3 | Measure loudness and sharpness |\n",
    "| **IMU** | 40 | Capture body motion patterns |\n",
    "| **TOTAL** | **105** | Complete multimodal signature |\n",

    "### Key Insights from Our Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Through our step-by-step walkthrough, we learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coughs have distinct characteristics:**\n",
    "   - Sharp, impulsive audio bursts (high crest factor)\n",
    "   - Strong high-frequency content (high spectral centroid/rolloff)\n",
    "   - Distinctive motion patterns (accelerometer + gyroscope spikes)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multimodal sensing is powerful:**\n",
    "   - Audio alone: Good, but struggles in noisy environments\n",
    "   - IMU alone: Captures motion, but misses acoustic details\n",
    "   - Combined: Robust detection across all conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Features enable machine learning:**\n",
    "   - Each window becomes a point in 105-dimensional space\n",
    "   - Coughs cluster in one region, non-coughs in another\n",
    "   - ML models learn to find the optimal decision boundary\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**You now understand the complete feature extraction pipeline!** 🎉\n",
    "\n",
    "The journey from raw biosignals → features → trained model is a fundamental workflow in biomedical signal processing and machine learning. The skills you've learned here apply to many other domains: speech recognition, activity recognition, ECG analysis, and more."
